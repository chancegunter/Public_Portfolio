\begin{enumerate}

\item (10 Points) {\bf Fix a Bad Graph, Number 1:} \\
Carefully look at the graph in Figure~\ref{org_freestyle}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{hw03_q01_Fig1_Freestyle.png}}
\caption{\label{org_freestyle} 
Original: Obtained from \url{https://wiki.fis-ski.com/index.php/Image:Average_age_winner_FS_WSC_1986-2009.PNG} in Fall 2021. The graph is no 
longer available at this URL at this time.}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item (3 Points) Explain which rule(s) 
(how to construct a bad graphic) from our lecture notes the graph
designer has followed, i.e., list the rule(s) (number and name)
and explain why it has been followed. Do not blindly list rules (numbers and names)
as you will lose points if you incorrectly quote a rule.
Be sure that you understand the difference between rules 3 and 4. \\


\underline{Answer:} \\
Figure \ref{org_freestyle} follows several ``Bad Graphics'' rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 9: Alabama First-
The X axis and the z axis are improperly sorted. The X axis visually is moving
right to left and not left to right for the dates. The z axis is not sorted
alphabetically. 

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 10: Label: (a) illegibly, (b) incompletely, (c) incorrectly,
and (d) ambiguously- 
The data is highly illegible and ambiguous. This is due to the amount of Nan's
recorded and the use of a third axis. To make matters worse the labels in the
table bellow the graph do not depict the same colors as those in the graph above
(at least by Shade). Lastly we view date as oldest to Newest moving left to
right and the graph has the opposite of this of Newest to Oldest.

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 11: More is murkier: (a) more decimal places and (b) more dimensions-
This data has the added dimension of Category or Sport. As a result the graph
has more dimensions than necessary. Due to this it is harder to understand the
impacts the Null data is causing. Another thing affected by this, the third
axis makes it more difficult to gauge grid lines regarding the Ages on the Y
axis.

\end{itemize}


\newpage


\item (4 Points) Demonstrate how this poor graph might be improved.
Using the data from the graph (or better, from the table from underneath the graph),
construct a superior representation of the same information, using R,
similar to the improvements from Section~6.2 of our lecture notes.
You can use any R package of your choice to create the improved version.

Note that the original graph uses abbreviations for the following terms:
Mogul (MO), Dual Mogul (DM),
Aerial (AE), Ski Cross (SX),
Half Pipe (HP), Acroski (AC), and
Slopestyle (CO).

In your improved version of this graph, work with the numbers from the table
below the graph and not the graph itself. It appears that the designer 
of the original graph messed up the graph...

Include a scan or a photo of the bad graph in your answer,
next to your improved version. Also include your R code. \\

\item (3 Points) Include a short write--up (about half a page) as to how you 
believe your version improves on the poor original. More specifically,
indicate what you have modified and why this improves the representation
of the underlying data.


\underline{Answer:} \\
I created Figure~\ref{fix_freestyle} (right) to rectify the issues described in part (a) above. 

The first thing that I did was remove the third dimension of category. Following
this I orientated the years to read from left to right. The ending result is 
a line plot with a clearly labeled legend (Full names of Categories) and axis
with appropriate labels. The original graphic had too much going on with the 
multi-dimensionality, the dates facing the wrong way reduced readability. Fixing
these issues allowed for a clear representation of Freestyle Ski Ages amongst
different sports.

\end{enumerate}


\newpage


\item (10 Points) {\bf Fix a Bad Graph, Number 2:} \\
Carefully look at the graph in Figure~\ref{org_starwars}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{hw03_q02_Fig2_StarWars.jpg}}
\caption{\label{org_starwars} Original: Obtained from \url{https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-single-most-said-word-in-the-first-6-Star-Wars-movies}, Fall 2018, accessed 11/13/2023.}
\end{figure}

Here some background about this graph. Someone asked this question on Quora:
``What is the single most said word in the first 6 Star Wars movies?''
The graph in Figure~\ref{org_starwars} was designed by Hakon Hapnes Strand
to answer this question. The graph shows the top-5 characters respectively
that speak jedi and master most often. 
Visit the web page for further details or to see other (bad) Star Wars related graphs.

Repeat parts (a) through (c) from the previous question for this graph.


\begin{enumerate}
\item \underline{Answer}: \\
Figure \ref{org_starwars} follows several ``Bad Graphics'' rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 1: Show as little data as possible (minimize the data density)-
There are only 5 data points on each of the plots, but the figure is
considerably filled with ink used for the bars.. 

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 10: (a) illegibly, (b) incompletely, (c) incorrectly, and (d)
ambiguously- 
The title and additional subtext do not provide an adequate description of the
graph. For example, there is no indicator that this is over the first 6 movies,
and there is no description as to why these characters were chosen. In movies
4-6, Darth Vader uses the word Jedi extensively but is not featured in the
Jedi plot.

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 3: Ignore the visual metaphor altogether- 
The plot depicting Jedi and the plot depicting Master are the same height, but
are of a different scale. As a result, the amount in which Anakin says Jedi (42)
looks the same as the amount in which Anakin says Master (72). The axes of the
two graphs should be the same if they are comparing the same y-value of word
count.

\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\item \underline{Answer:} \\
I created Figure~\ref{fix_starwars} (right) to rectify the issues described in part (a) above.

The starwars graphs tried to convey to much with a small amount of data. To 
rectify this I combined the previous bargraphs into one dotplot. The charts 
shared several of the same charaters and were scalled different so in doing so
it allowed for a better prespective of the wordcount data as a whole. In 
addition to this there should be more description regarding why they chose this
data, for example in movies 4-6 Vader says Jedi a lot however it was not 
represented. As a result some of the characters only have 1 data point while 
others have 2.

\end{enumerate}


\newpage


\item (20 Points) {\bf Find your own bad graph (FYOBG)!:} \\
Now, you have to find your own bad graph and fix it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 Points) 
Find a bad graph from the past 5 years (since 2018) 
you want to discuss and improve for this homework question.
``Claim'' your bad graph via a personal announcement to me via e-mail or in Canvas. Be specific
which graph you want to improve, in particular if there is more than one bad graph
shown. Include the URL for a graph found on the web, the full reference with page number 
and figure number for a bad graph from a publication, or all necessary details for a bad graph found in a 
newspaper, in class materials, etc.  Also include a photo, scan, or screenshot of your bad graph.

Also, summarize what makes this a bad graph. You do not have to cite the exact bad-graphs rules 
from the lecture notes at this time, but it must be clear that you found 
an F-grade graph (a D- still would be a pass for a graph) and recognized its worst problems.

Web pages, journal articles, newspapers, magazines, videos, 
and scholarly books are all appropriate sources.
Good sources for bad graphs are CNN, Time magazine,
the Utah Statesman, Wikipedia, and many other online sites,
but also textbooks and journal papers.

If you find a bad graph in the public, take a photo and describe where
it was located, e.g., in a poster you noticed on a certain floor 
in a certain USU building. In this case, also include a photo of the entire
source and not only the bad graph.
Other suitable sources might be ads, signs, things shown on TV, etc.
For these, also submit a photo of the bad graph,
if possible a photo of the entire source, and describe where you found it.

Your bad graph must meet at least one of the rules for bad graphs from Chapter 6 in our lecture notes. 

{\bf Each student must claim a bad graph by Monday, 11/13/2023, 11:59pm. Each student must
claim a different graph. If you claim a graph that was previously claimed by someone
else (or that was used in a previous semester), you must find and claim a different graph.}

Note that numerous web sites with overviews of bad graphs exist.
Some examples are \\
\url{https://www.businessinsider.com/the-27-worst-charts-of-all-time-2013-6}, \\
\url{https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/}, \\
\url{https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/graphs-that-lied-to-us}, \\
and several more. 

Here is my collection of bad Covid graphs (plus a few good ones): \\
\url{https://math.usu.edu/~symanzik/talks/2021_SouthwestMichiganChapter.pdf}

{\bf You cannot use any bad graph that is posted on these or any other
bad-graph-collection web sites, books on bad graphs, or other similar publications.
The goal of this HW is NOT to reuse a bad graph that has already been marked
as bad by someone else, but rather to identify a (new) bad graph when we see it!}


\newpage


\item (5 Points) I will combine all proposed bad graphs into a PowerPoint presentation.
Each bad graph is shown on a single page, including the name of the student who claimed it
and the source. {\bf Each student will have a maximum of 2~min to introduce the bad graph
in our last in-person lecture on Thursday 11/16/2023}:
(i) Mention the source of the graph; (ii) indicate the rule(s) [from the 12 bad graph
rules in Section 6.1 of the lecture notes] that have been followed
to make it a bad graph; and (iii) briefly outline how you are going to improve this graph,
e.g., whether you change the type of the graph, modify the layout, etc.
Always refer to the number and name of these rules.
You should practice in advance that you don't speak longer than 2~min!

{\bf Note: If you are unable to attend our last in-person lecture on Thursday 11/16/2023, 
you have to do the following:
Send me a 2~min recording that shows your name, the bad graph, and the URL on the screen.
Then provide the information for (i) to (iii) listed in (b) above. 
When completed, send me your recording via \url{https://bft.usu.edu/} or provide me with a link
to Box, Google Drive, etc.\ that allows me to access your recording. 
This recording is due on Wednesday 11/15/2023 by 12noon (so I can check it in advance).
I will  play your recording in our last in-person lecture 
on Thursday 11/16/2023 as part of the presentations.

*** In any case, you must contact me in advance via e-mail if you are
not able to attend our last in-person lecture on Thursday 11/16/2023. ***}


\newpage


\item (10 Points) Repeat parts (a) through (c) from the two previous questions for your bad graph.
In your discussion, include the exact source of your bad graph, i.e., the information
you initially sent to me when you claimed your graph. \\

\end{figure}

\underline{Answer}: \\
(a) My selected bad graph follows several ``Bad Graphics'' rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 8: Jigging the Baseline-
Due to the stacked nature of the this plot it is hard to tell the 
growth of the individual categories. For Example 49-50 percent we see
a change in total of 1 percent while the y axis is in units leaving the
viewer to preform som ration analysis to find an estimate of the final
unit value. This is further complicated by the missing 400 unit grid line.

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 1: Show as Little Data as Possible-  
Similar to the U.S. vs Japan labor statistic this is a comparison of 
percentages while the scale is based on units. Another thing to note is 
that during the duration from the beginning to the end is smoothed and not
accurately representing the value at that given point in time.

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 3: Ignore the visual metaphor altogether- 
The highlighted percentages are misleading, the graph indicates for 
incinerated, landfill, and mismanaged waste categories that there is a
change from 2019-2060. However, That is not reflected in the visual
representation where the largest reflections of this are 49-50 percent
and the 22-15 percent.

\end{itemize}


(b) An improved version can be created as follows:

{\scriptsize
<<eval=TRUE>>=
data_df <- read.csv("data.csv")

library(gridExtra)

# Assuming you have a data frame named 'data' with columns: Year,
# Category, Value

categories <- unique(data_df$Category[data_df$Category != ""])
print(categories)

y_range <- range(data_df$Value, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create a list to store the plots
plots_list <- list()

for (category in categories) {
  # Subset the data for the current category
  subset_data <- data_df[data_df$Category == category, ]
  
  # Create the plot
  p <- ggplot(subset_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Category)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = paste("Plastic Waste by", category),
         x = "Year", y = "Million Tonnes") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.position = 'right', legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5,
                             keywidth = 0.8, keyheight = 0.8,
                             nrow = 7)) +
    ylim(y_range)  # Set y-axis limits
  
  # Add the plot to the list
  plots_list[[category]] <- p
}
# Arrange the plots in a 2x2 matrix
arranged_plots <- grid.arrange(grobs = plots_list, ncol = 2)

# Save the arranged plots to a PDF file
ggsave("hw03_sol_Fixed_Recycling.pdf", arranged_plots, width = 7, height = 5)

\end{figure}

(c) \underline{Improvements of the bad graph:} \\
To fix these Rule issues I created several subplots. These subplots are split
out by subcategory of waste management type. All the axises are scaled the same.
The previous plot was an area chart combined in a stacked nature with percentage
labels. These new graphs are line graphs show less of a change than previously
indicated.

Moreover, make sure that your R code is consistent, i.e., that you use the same
type of comments and the same type of quotes throughout your entire homework.

\item Give credit to external sources, such as stackoverflow or help pages. Be specific
and include the full URL where you found the help (or from which help page you got 
the information). Make sure to properly format code from such external sources 
via {\it styler}.

\item If you have used ChatGPT or any other AI tool, you have to acknowledge its use.
Be specific for which question/question parts it has been used --- and for which purpose,
e.g., to write certain code for you or just fix the grammar in your text.

\item {\bf Not following the general instructions outlined above will result in point deductions!}

\item For general questions related to this homework, please
use the corresponding discussion board in Canvas! I will try to
reply as quickly as possible. Moreover, if one of you knows
an answer, please post it. It is fine to refer to web pages
and R commands, but do not provide the exact R command with all required arguments
or which of the suggestions from a stackoverflow web page eventually worked for you! 
This will be the task for each individual student!

\item Submit your single pdf file via Canvas by the submission deadline.
Recall the {\bf No Excuse Needed Late Homework Submission Policy}
from the syllabus. Make use of your three tokens wisely.
