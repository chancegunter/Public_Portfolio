Crypto Currency Trading
 
This project is trading simulations on 6 crypto currencies of my choice (i.e. bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, ripple, eos, litecoin, ethereum)
I pulled the price data from a web json api, and save it to csv files.
The program will run two trading strategies (shorting and simple moving average) on the crypto currency prices.
The program saves new data into the files.  Meaning, when I go to run the program, it should go get the latest data, update the files, and run new analysis.
If the program detects a buy signal or sell signal on the last day in the data, print a message like “You should <buy or sell> this stock today”.
Stores your results to your strategy in a results.json, and specifically identifying which crypto currency and strategy made the most profit.
